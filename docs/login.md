# Log in to Bianca

!!! info "Objectives" 

    - We'll go through the methods to log in
    
!!! note

    - Remember that Rackham is your friend as well in your work. 
    - Being able to work there as well will improve your possibilities to work effectively when you also need some sort of internet connection. For instance:
        - installing tools
        - installing Python, R and Julia packages
        - transfer scripts
        - updating your git repositories (not containing sensitive data)

## Bianca's design

- Bianca was designed
    - to make accidental data leaks difficult
    - to make correct data management as easy as possible
    - to emulate the HPC cluster environment that SNIC users were familiar with
    - to provide a maximum amount of resources
    - and to satisfy regulations.
    
### Bianca has no Internet
    - Still you can log in, but it is done in two steps!
    - We recomend the ThinLink web portal, to enable graphics

![Bianca](./img/biancaorganisation-01.png)

- Bianca is only accessible from within Sunet (i.e. from university networks).
- Use VPN outside Sunet. [Link to VPN for UU](https://mp.uu.se/en/web/info/stod/it-telefoni/it-support/network-on-campus/vpn-service)
  - You can get VPN credentials from all Swedish universities.

<br>

- The whole Bianca cluster (blue) contains hundreds of virtual project clusters (green), each of which is isolated from each other and the Internet.
- Data can be transferred to or from a virtual project cluster through the Wharf, which is a special file area that is visible from the Internet.


## Log in

- You can log in either through ThinLinc or via ssh
- If you are using graphics of an kind, use ThinLinc
- Otherwise, if you just ned the commandline, it is enough to use ssh.
    - ssh from home terminal
    - ssh from a session on Rackham 

## Log in to Bianca with ThinLinc

- Bianca offers graphical login
    - You need to be on SUNET or use VPN
    - On web:
        - [https://bianca.uppmax.uu.se](https://bianca.uppmax.uu.se)
        - requires [2-factor authentication](https://www.uppmax.uu.se/support/user-guides/setting-up-two-factor-authentication/)

!!! warning

    The ThinLinc application will work for Rackham but not Bianca

### The log in steps
1. When you log in to [https://bianca.uppmax.uu.se](https://bianca.uppmax.uu.se), your SSH or ThinLinc client first meets the blue Bianca login node.
    - user name: `<username>-<projid>@bianca.uppmax.uu.se`
        - like: `myname-sens2023531@bianca.uppmax.uu.se`
    - password: your password, directly followed by the 6-digit 2-factor
        - like: verysecret678123
2. After checking your [2-factor authentication] this server looks for your virtual project cluster.
3. If it's present, then you are transferred to a login prompt on your cluster's login node. If not, then the virtual cluster is started.
    - you are prompted to give your username and password again, this time without projid and 2nd-factor:
         - username: `<myname>`
         - password: verysecret
4. Inside each virtual project cluster, by default there is just a one-core login node. When you need more memory or more CPU power, you submit a job (interactive or batch), and an idle node will be moved into your project cluster.


## Log in via ssh
    
You may try to log in any of your terminals <https://uppmax.github.io/uppmax_intro/login2.html#terminals>
    
``` bash
    $ ssh <user>-sens2023531@bianca.uppmax.uu.se
```
- you are prompted to give your password directly followed by the 6-digit 2-factor
        - like: verysecret678123


## Start an interactive session
    
To be able to work with the type alongs we strongly recommend you to start an interactive session already now.

- More about interactive sessions and Slurm in the afternoon, but we don't need a further insight in this to proceed now!
   
!!! info "Start the interactive session"
    
    We start an 8 hour session with 2 cores.
    
    ``` bash
    $ interactive -A sens2023531 -p core -n 2 -t 8:0:0
    ```
    

    
!!! abstract "keypoints"
    - We recommend you to use ThinLinc to log in when you need graphics
